      ## Why buy from me?

      I was an employee of [Salem Techsperts](https://salemtechsperts.com?ref=aspy.dev).
      I did most of the refurbishing, so you can expect the same level of quality!
      
      I was let go because we were not bringing in enough profit to sustain the laptop refurbishing business
